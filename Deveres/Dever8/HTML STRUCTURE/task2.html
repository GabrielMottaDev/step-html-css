        <h1>Types of Tags</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>Each HTML tag has its own meaning and purpose.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Some tags are service ones and you cannot see them on a page</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Other tags are used fot text formatting and you can really see their influence</p>
        <br/>
        <p>For example, if we wrap text in the h1 tag, it becomes bigger and there will be paddings because h1 is a header</p>
